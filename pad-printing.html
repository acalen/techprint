		<article>
		  <p>While crude forms of pad printing have existed for centuries, it was not until the twentieth century that the technology became suitable for widespread use.</p>
		  <p>First gaining a foothold in the watch-making industry following World War II, developments in the late 60s and early 70s, such as silicone pads and more advanced equipment, made the printing method far more practical.</p>
		  <p>The ability to print on formerly unprintable surfaces caught the imaginations of engineers and designers, and as a result pad printing exploded into the mass production marketplace.</p>
		  <p>Today, pad printing is a well-established technology covering a wide specturm of industires and applications. Techprint, Inc. uses a variety of pad printing machines, ranging in size from 50mm to 150mm.</p>
		  <p>Pad printing utilizes a photo etched plate for the legends and silicone pads to transfer the legend to the part.  Due to the pads unique flexibility, pad printing is well suited for odd shapes, textures, and multiple surfaces.</p>

	    <article>
		  <p>We primarily use two types of ink during our pad printing process: epoxy inks and sublimation inks.</p>
		  <p>The use of epoxy inks is well suited to this printing method.  One and two-part epoxy inks work well with a wide variety of materials, we even employ flexible epoxies which are excellent for printing on soft flexible materials.</p>
		  <p>We also use sublimation ink, which is specifically made to molecularly bond with and dye the material being printed.  From there an amount of direct radiant heat is required to sublimate the image to the part.  Due to this, we recommend that the material to be used in this method be a high temperature thermoplastic.  However, colors for this process are limited since you can't dye an image that is lighter than the material.</p>
		  <p>Our rotary process is substantially different than what is currently offered by the standard rotary printing machines.  Check out our <a href="rotary-printing.html">rotary printing</a> page to see what we offer.</p>
